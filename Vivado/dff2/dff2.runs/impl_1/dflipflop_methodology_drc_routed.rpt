2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.635 ns between q_reg/C (clocked by clk) and q (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.628 ns between d (clocked by clk) and q_reg/D (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-4#1 Warning
User Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous user clock constraint with the same name.
New: create_clock -period 0.050 -name clk -waveform {0.000 0.025} [get_ports clk] (Source: /home/kanish/System_Design_through_FPGA/Vivado/dff2/dff2.srcs/constrs_1/imports/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 33))
Previous: create_clock -period 0.050 -name clk -waveform {0.000 0.025} -add (Source: /home/kanish/System_Design_through_FPGA/Vivado/dff2/dff2.srcs/constrs_1/imports/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 32))
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#1 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of 0.000 ns has been defined on port 'd' relative to clock clk for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_input_delay -clock [get_clocks clk] -max -add_delay 0.000 [get_ports d]
/home/kanish/System_Design_through_FPGA/Vivado/dff2/dff2.srcs/constrs_1/imports/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 37)
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#2 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 0.000 ns has been defined on port 'q' relative to clock clk for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks clk] -max -add_delay 0.000 [get_ports q]
